    /* Would like something here where the player has to figure out a combination to unlock the computer
     to continue the ship on its voyage. Not sure how to do it just yet.
     
     This ties into the medical suite where the player will have to search the captain's body for a notebook
     containing the computer code to start the engines; as well as key that will let the player into the 
     captains ready room.
     
     Initial thoughts are that the player won't even see the option to enter the ready room if they don't have
     the key. Perhaps there they can find some sort of weapon or something that will let them fight the monster
     that is in the crew quarters?*/
