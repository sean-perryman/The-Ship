#The-Ship
========
Written initially in Xcode, but will work on porting over to Visual C++ as well as trying to figure out
what it will take to get it to compile in Linux.

Still trying to sort out the whole process, but there will be a couple of puzzles to figure out to get
through the game. Shooting for a 15-20 minute play time start to finish if the player is fresh to the game.
Maybe like 5 minutes if they know what they are doing?

I've been thinking I might perhaps convert this game to a Windows Form application with buttons instead. I feel like that would make it a little more friendlier, plus allow for some graphical backgrounds and make the sound effects and music much easier to do. 

This was inspired by the WRATH LANDS tutorial series by Mark Troyer.
